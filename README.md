# hello-world
This is my first repository on GitHub.

A little about myself, I'm Matt, 33 years old and from Sydney, Australia. I have been using computers since I started school but never learnt how to code despite always being interested. I have been using Excel for the past 10+ years which naturally lead to playing in a bit vba. 

I have just started an online computer science course (edX cs50) and look forward to being a part of this community.
