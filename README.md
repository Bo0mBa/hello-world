# hello-world
This is my first repository

I'm Matt, a 33 year old and from Sydney, Austrailia. I have been using computers since I started school but never learnt how to code despite always being interested in computers. I have been using Excel for the past 10+ years natrually lead to solving problems in vba. 

I have just started an online computer science course (edX cs50) and look forward to learning and being a part of this community.
